GraphQLize identifies the relationships between database tables using their foreign keys, and generate appropriate relationship fields (conections) in the resulting GraphQL schema.

## One to One

For the database table relationships like above, GraphQLize infers two `one-to-one` relationships.

- A `address` is associated with a `city` via `city_id` column in the `address` table.

- A `city` is associated with a `country` via `country_id` column in the `city` table.

GraphQLize then create two object relationsips in the `Address` and the `City` type respectively

```graphql
type Address {
  # ...
  city: City!
}

type City {
  # ...
  country: Country!
}
```

The generated field name is the _camelCase_ version of the corresponding column name with the id suffix `_id` removed.

Here are some of the examples.

| Column Name            | GraphQL Field Name |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| actor_id               | actor              |
| original_language_id   | originalLanguage   |
| reports_to_employee_id | reportsToEmployee  |

By default, GraphQLize assumes `_id` as the suffix for foriegn keys in both Postgres and MySQL.

[In future](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/4), GraphQLize will provide a configuration to override this default behaviour.
