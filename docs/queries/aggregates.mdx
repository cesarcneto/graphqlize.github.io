GraphQLize supports the standard aggregate functions `count`, `max`, `min`, `sum` & `avg`. We can also use the `GROUP-BY` operation along with these aggregate functions.

```graphql
query {
  courses {
    countOfRating
    avgOfRating
    maxOfRating
    minOfRating
    sumOfRating
  }
}
```

The aggregate functions over columns are available as `fields` in the corresponding `type` representing the table.

```graphql
type Course {
  # ...
  rating: Int!

  # ... aggregate functions as fields
  avgOfRating: BigDecimal
  countOfRating: Int!
  maxOfRating: Int
  minOfRating: Int
  sumOfRating: Int
  # ...
}
```

## Naming Convention

As seen in the above example, GraphQLize uses the name of the aggregate function (in camel case) along with the preposition `Of` as prefix to represent the aggregate functions as fields.

| Column Name | Aggregate Function | Field            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| first_name  | count              | countOfFirstName |
| payment     | sum                | sumOfPayment     |


## Aggregates Over Relationships

We can use the aggregate functions over the relationship fields as well. 

Let's assume that we have a schema like below 

![](/img/author_course_er_diagram.png)

We can get the total courses count and the average course rating of all the authors along with their first-name and last-name, using the following GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  authors {
    id
    firstName
    courses {
      # highlight-next-line
      countOfId 
      # highlight-next-line
      avgOfRating
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
The `countOfId` field translates to `count(id)` in the SQL's select clause. The count of all rows via `count(*)` will be added in a future release.
:::

## GROUP BY

The aggregate functions often paired along with the GROUP BY operation and GraphQLize supports it out of the box!

For the above schema, we can group the courses by their rating and get their count using the following query

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  courses(groupBy: [rating]) {
    rating
    countOfRating
  }
}
```
