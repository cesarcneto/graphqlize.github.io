GraphQLize generetes GraphQL query types for all the tables and the views by default.

For a table and a view like below,

```sql
CREATE TABLE actor (
-- ...
);

CREATE VIEW customer_list
AS
-- ...
```

GraphQLize generates the following queryies

```graphql
type QueryRoot {
  actors: [Actor]!
  customerLists: [CustomerList]!
  # ...
}

schema {
  query: QueryRoot
}
```

The query name generation follows the below convention.

`camel-case(pluralize(table-or-view-name))`

## Sample Queries

```graphql
query {
  # Table Name: `actor`
  actors {
    # Column Name: `first_name`
    firstName
    # Column Name: `last_name`
    lastName
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  # View Name: `customer_list`
  customerLists {
    # Column Name: `name`
    name
    # Column Name: `zip code`
    zipCode
  }
}
```
