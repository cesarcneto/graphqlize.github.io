You can filter the query results in GraphQLize using the `where` argument. 

## Comparison Operators

### Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  cities(where: {cityId: {eq: 3}}) {
    city
  }
}
```
### Not Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {name: {neq: "English"}}) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Greater Than

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {gt: 11.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```

### Greater Than Or Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {gte: 11.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```
### Less Than 

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {lt: 6.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```
### Less Than Or Equal To

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {amount: {lte: 6.99}}) {
    rentalId
    amount
  }
}
```

### Between

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {paymentDate: {between: {from: "2005-08-23T21:00:00", to: "2005-08-23T21:03:00"}}}) {
    rentalId
  }
}
```

### Is Null

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  employees(where: {employeeReportsToId: {isNull: true}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

### Is Not Null

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  employees(where: {employeeReportsToId: {isNotNull: true}}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

### IN

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {customerId: {in: [1, 2]}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```
### NOT IN

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {customerId: {notIn: [1, 2]}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

### String Comparison

#### Like

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  countries(where: {country: {like: "A%"}}) {
    country
  }
}
```
#### Not Like
```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line
  countries(where: {country: {notLike: "A%"}}) {
    country
  }
}
```

## Logical Operators

### AND

```graphql
query {
  # payments of a customer with the id `1` 
  # and amount greater than `5.99`
  # highlight-next-line
  payments(where: {and: {customerId: {eq: 1}, amount: {gt: 5.99}}}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

`and` also supports list of conditions. 

The above query can be rewritten as

```graphql
query {
  # highlight-next-line 
  payments(where: {and: [{customerId: {eq: 1}, amount: {gt: 5.99}}]}) {
    paymentId
    amount
  }
}
```

### OR

`or` is similar to `and` in syntax. It accepts both a single condition or a list of conditions. 

```graphql
query {
  # languages with the name either "English" or "French"
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {or: [{name: {eq: "English"}}, {name: {eq: "French"}}]}) {
    languageId
    name
  }
}
```

### NOT

Using the `not` operator we can invert the filter condition. 

```graphql
query {
  # languages with the name except "English" or "French"
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(where: {not: {or: [{name: {eq: "English"}}, {name: {eq: "French"}}]}}) {
    languageId
    name
  }
}
```



## Filtering nested objects

GraphQLize also supports filtering nested objects. 

```graphql
query {
  countryByCountryId(countryId: 2) {
    country
    # filter one-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    cities(where: {city: {like: "B%"}}) {
      cityId
      city
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  actorByActorId(actorId: 148) {
    firstName
    # filter many-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    films(where: {title: {like: "S%"}}) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
