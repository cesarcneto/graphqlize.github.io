GraphQLize enables sorting the query results using the `orderBy` argument. By default any of the table columns can be used to sort the query results. 


## Sorting by single column

```graphql
query languagesSortedByName {
  # sorts using the `name` column in the `language` table
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(orderBy: {name: ASC}) {
    name
  }
}
```

If you'd like to sort it descending order, just change `ASC` to `DESC`. 

```graphql
query languagesSortedByNameInDescOrder {
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(orderBy: {name: DESC}) {
    name
  }
}
```

## Sorting by multiple columns

You can sort by multiple columns as well!


```graphql
query {
  # sorts the `actor` table by the `first_name` column 
  # and then by `last_name` column in descending order
  # highlight-next-line
  actors(orderBy: {firstName: ASC, lastName: DESC}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

## Sorting nested objects

GraphQLize also supports sorting nested objects. 

```graphql
query {
  countryByCountryId(countryId: 2) {
    country
    # sorting one-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    cities(orderBy: {city: DESC}) {
      city
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query {
  actorByActorId(actorId: 148) {
    firstName
    # sorting many-to-many relationship
    # highlight-next-line
    films(orderBy: {title: DESC}) {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Currently, sorting nested objects in MySQL is not supported. [It'll be fixed](https://github.com/graphqlize/graphqlize/issues/52) in a later release.
