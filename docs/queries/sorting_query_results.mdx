GraphQLize enables sorting the query results using the `orderBy` argument. By default any of the table columns can be used to sort the query results. 


## Sorting by single column

```graphql
query languagesSortedByName {
  # sorts using the `name` column in the `language` table
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(orderBy: {name: ASC}) {
    name
  }
}
```

If you'd like to sort it descending order, just change `ASC` to `DESC`. 

```graphql
query languagesSortedByNameInDescOrder {
  # highlight-next-line
  languages(orderBy: {name: DESC}) {
    name
  }
}
```

## Sorting by multiple columns

You can sort by multiple columns as well!


```graphql
query {
  # sorts the `actor` table by the `first_name` column 
  # and then by `last_name` column in descending order
  # highlight-next-line
  actors(orderBy: {firstName: ASC, lastName: DESC}) {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```
